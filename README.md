### How it Works?
How does it Work ?Phishing refers to an online scam in which criminals impersonate genuine organizations through email, text messages, advertisements, or other methods to obtain sensitive information. Typically, this involves providing a link that appears to direct you to the legitimate company's website, where you enter your information. However, the website is a well-crafted fake, and the information you submit goes directly to the scammers. To effectively identify these malicious websites, we employ a Machine Learning technique called Artificial Neural Network, which has been trained on a dataset of 600,000 authentic and malicious URLs.
